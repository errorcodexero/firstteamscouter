COMPLETED:
Get the menu back on the main screen
Make pictures deletable


Pictures:
Select one robot picture to represent the team
Show the robot picture on the match team screen
Show a 50x50 version of the robot image on the Starting Position and AutoMode screens
Add small thumbnail of robot to Pit Info page


Match Scouting:
Show the team number on all match screens
Label the Step gauge
Update the Notes screen to include new fields for this year
Add an option to start with yellow totes removed from auto field
Set the field background and orientation correctly based on scouting position
Add an element to track a team�s highest possible stack (in notes section) -- add a highlight on the gauges to show the highest stack so far
Add numbers to the gauge levels
Placing an item on a populated level of a gauge shifts the set upward or downward, if it is at bottom or top
When setting field background, translate the coordinates correctly before storing them
Gauge level 7 should only be for cans - update the background to show can silhouette at all times
Highlight on gauge should mirror what is in the TransportContainer
Minimize the elements at the bottom of the Telemode screen - one of each type per position
Implement the Rotate button in Telemode to rotate the elements across the bottom of the screen
Add a button to allow the scouter to manually add a new robot gauge
Dynamically add robot gauges equal to the number of stacks from the robot data
Add a 'Drop' area to left of robot gauges
Add a 'Knock Over' button which activates all non-robot gauges and allows totes/cans to be selected for knock-over
Extend the 'Step' gauge to be 6 levels high (max yellow tote stack)
Change notes on match screen to use list like in pit scouting
If a robot ends Automode with an element in its manipulator, add it to the robot gauge in Telemode
The robot disappears if it is moved too far onto the field in auto
There should be some way to show litter (from hp and ground)



Pit Scouting:
Add a SW language to the robot profile
Add a Tote Manipulator to the Robot Profile (e.g. Forklift)
Add a Can Manipulator to the Robot Profile
Handling mechanism?
Drive range?
Drive team skills?
Coopertition? Or nah?
Stack from? (bottom, top, both)


Application Work:
When app is closed, resets to first match. Could it reset to last scouted match?


Data Export:
REMOVE NOTE CONNECTION TABLE, MAKE NOTEDATA THE ONLY NOTE TABLE, USE OWNER ID AND NOTE TYPE
Export all data from SQLite DB
Set up SQL server on laptop
Write exported data to SQL server, if available - CSV if not
Add setting for SQL Server address and ability to test the connection

Current Database Work:
Store matches under a corresponding competition
Add competition field to import function and CSV headers


Future Database Work:
Add way to delete competition and match
Add ability to assign a robot to a competition/match
Separate robot info into competition-agnostic and competition-dependent fields (e.q. wheel-type vs can lifter type)
Add a 'Season' table to the DB
Add a 'SeasonCompetition' table to the DB
Add a 'SeasonRobotData' table to the DB
The robot profile shouild pull from RobotData and SeasonRobotData
Add a SeasonTeamRobotData table to the DB
Robot is assigned to a team, and can be selected for one or more seasons for multiple competitions in those season(s)













Notes from Oregon City:
Scouting App Notes:
X when scouting for red alliance, the onscreen field is flipped 
X the stack option for the step is unlabeled
X final screen still says ball control and lists roles from last year
X add an option to remove yellow totes from auto field
X the knock over element and those around it appear to do nothing
X add an element to track a team�s highest possible stack (in notes section)
X the robot disappears if it is moved too far onto the field in auto
X when app is closed, resets to first match. Could it reset to last scouted match?
X there should be some way to show litter (from hp and ground)

Pit Scouting Notes:
needs to happen on friday
needs two people: notetaker and question-askererer
ran out of time quickly
Questions:
X Drive base?
X Handling mechanism?
X Max # of totes stacked?
X Drive range?
XXX # of stacks built in a match? - you get this from live data
X Drive team skills?
X Coopertition? Or nah?
teams tend to talk a lot about their robots
didn�t use tablets because tablets were used for field scouting
